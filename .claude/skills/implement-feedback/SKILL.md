# Implement Feedback Skill
1. Read the feedback list completely before starting
2. Create a tracking checklist of ALL items
3. For each item: read existing code first, use existing patterns, implement minimal change
4. Track deferred items explicitly — never dismiss as 'no action needed'
5. After all items: run type check, show summary of completed vs deferred
